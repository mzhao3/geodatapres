    <h3> <a name = "1"> What is a geodatabase? </a></h3>
    <p> A geodatabase is a relational database that stores geographic data. It is a container for storing <b> spatial and attribute data </b> and the relationships that exist among them. Geodatabases store information in vector data format. They come in many sizes, can have varying numbers of users, and can be created, edited, and can be managed using programs like ArcCatalog™ and ArcMap™.

    The layers in the image above are examples of the types of geographic data that might be found in a geodatabase.

    The geodatabase contains three primary dataset types: feature classes, raster datasets, and tables.
    <d1>
      <dt> Feature Class </dt>
        <dd>  - a table with a shape field containing point, line, or polygon geometries for geographic features.
        </dd>
      <dt> Raster Dataset</dt>
        <dd>  - contains rasters (in other words, the image is made up of pixels) which represent continuous geographic phenomena.
        </dd>
      <dt> Table</dt>
        <dd>  - collection of rows, each containing the same fields.
          <ul>
            <li> Feature classes are tables with shape fields.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
    </d1>

    In this image, you can see the different types of dataset types that can be found in the geodatabase. In the upper left is a table, with the typical rows and columns. These tables contain information that can be queried. In the upper right is topology, represented by pixels in varying shades. This is a raster dataset. On the bottom are visual representations of feature classes, which is how they will appear on the map creatd by the geodatabase. In the database, they are stored as tables with an extra column that defines them as shapes, as can be seen in the image below.

    Geodatabases are object relational. The information is stored as rows that have identities- these are the geodatabase objects.
    When the tables are stored in DataBase Management Systems (DMBM) like Oracle, IBM DB2, PostgreSQL, or Microsoft SQL server, they are generally stored using a SQL spatial type, and can be accessed with SQL.

    <h3><a name = "2"> Types of Geodatabases </a></h3>
    <p>
      Geodatabases can scale from small, single-user databases built on files up to larger workgroup geodatabases accessible by many users.  There are a few main types:
      <ul>
        <li> Personal geodatabases </li>
        <li> File geodatabases </li>
        <li> Enterprise geodatabases </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h4> Personal Geodatabases </h4>
    <br>
    <img src="/static/img4.png"width = "250px" height = "100px">
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li> Have a .mdb file extension (Microsoft Access database format).
        <ul>
          <li> Windows only </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> Has a 2GB size limitation. </li>
      <li> Can be read by multiple people at a time, but edited by only one person at a time. </li>
      <li> Better choice for outputs and analysis.</li>
      <li> Data can be transferred to an enterprise geodatabase using ArcCatalog™.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4> File Geodatabases </h4>
    <br>
    <img src="/static/img5.png"width = "250px" height = "100px">
    <br>
      <ul>
        <li> Have a .gdb file extension. </li>
        <li> Each dataset is a separate file on disk. All the datasets that belong to one geodatabase are contained in a single folder. </li>
        <li> By default, each dataset can grow to 1TB. </li>
        <li> Can be read by multiple people at a time, but edited by only one person at a time.</li>
        <li> Better choice for editing and storing large amounts of information.</li>
      </ul>

    <h4> Enterprise Geodatabases </h4>
    <ul>
      <li> Suitable for large workgroups. </li>
      <li> Can be read and edited by multiple users at the same time. </li>
      <li> Can store both vector and raster data </li>
      <li> Require ArcSDE software (allows you to view and work with data) and DBMS (stores spatial data).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> <a name = "3"> Usage with Python </a> </h3>
    <p> All geoprocessing tools can be accessed from Python using ArcPy. Simply include the following code in order to use it: <br>
      <code>
        import arcpy <br>
        arcpy.env.workspace = "c:/PATH/file_name.gdb" <br>
        result = arcpy.function_name(parameter, parameter)

      </code>
    </p>

    <h3> <a name = "4"> Advantages of Geodatabases </a> </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Multiple types of GIS data can be stored in a single geodatabase, making it easier to manage and access. </li>
      <li> Supports 2-, 3-, and 4-D vector features. </li>
      <li> Can be compressed to .zip files, so they are much better for datasets massive in size. </li>
      <li> There is no limit to the geodatabase size (tables and feature classes have a limit of 1TB).</li>
      <li> Geographic features and attribute data can be separated. </li>
      <li> Larger datasets are easier to access and manage. </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <img src="/static/img8.png"width = "300px" height = "100px">
    <br>
    The alternative to geodatabases are shapefiles, a digital vector storage format for storing geometric location and associated attribute information. This format lacks the capacity to store topological information (raster files). Shapefiles require three types of files:
    <ul>
      <li>.shp – this file stores the geometry of the feature</li>
      <li>.shx – this file stores the index of the geometry</li>
      <li>.dbf – this file stores the attribute information for the feature</li>
    </ul>
    All of the information is scattered across multiple files, which must be stored in the same location with the same name or else the shapefile will not load.

    <h3> <a name = "5">Drawbacks of Geodatabases </a> </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Geodatabases (especially file geodatabases) need specific programs like ArcCatalog in order to run. Once outside of this environment, it becomes less consumable. </li>
      <ul>
        <li> Compare this to shapefiles, which can be consumed by almost 100% of GIS software. </li>
      </ul>
      <li> Shapefiles are better for cross-platform sharing. </li>
      <li> Databases require extra knowledge of administration, querying, managing joins/relates, etc. </li>
    </ul>
